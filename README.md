[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)-based infrastructure configuration management


## About

This repository contains tools I use to manage my infrastructure.
Most of it assumes you are working with an Ansible environment.
There are other scripts and tools independent of Ansible that are used across my infrastructure.
Together, these resources provide an example of what open infrastructure looks like.


## Contributing

Suggested changes and improvements are welcome.
I cannot guarantee I will accept all contributions, but feedback and suggested improvements are encouraged.
I am a single person, so there's no way I can know everything.

As of now, there are no specific guidelines to contributing other than explaining the following:

1. What changes you are making
2. Why you are making them
3. The overall effect of your changes

If you answer these questions well, I'll more than likely accept your pull request.
