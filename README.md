## About

This repository contains all of the sysadmin goodness that's used to manage my infrastructure, like scripts, Ansible-related files and playbooks, and other fun things. The resources in this repository are for my personal infrastructure, learning purposes, or testing. These resources aim to help provide an example of an open infrastructure.
